Hi everyoneðŸ‘‹ I'm Rob! I'm currently a senior in the Honors program at the University of Michigan, where I am majoring in Computer
Science with a minor in Music. I have just completed an internship at Qualtrics as a Software Development Engineering Intern,
where I built a web portal using React which automated the submission of regulatory files. Previously, I worked as a Research
Assistant with a professor from UM's School of Information, where I helped author and revise a computer science e-book which
serves as a companion to a series of Coursera courses taken by millions of beginner programmers. Other previous experience
includes working at DTE Energy over the course of three summers. In 2021, I worked in IT on their cybersecurity team and obtained
a Microsoft Azure AZ-900 Certification. In 2020, I worked on a different team in IT where I developed a chat-bot that, using
language understanding technology, can interpret and answer a user's questions about Microsoft Teams. In 2019, I worked on the
Cable and Conduit Design team. In my free time, I sing in the University of Michigan Men's Glee Club, where I am the Stage
Manager and Tickets Manager.

The best way to contact me is via email at robminer@gmail.com or robminer@umich.edu - either works. Please don't hesitate to reach
out with any opportunities!
