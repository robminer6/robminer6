Hi everyoneðŸ‘‹ I'm Rob! I'm currently a Software Developer at Epic in Verona, WI, where I work on the EpicCare Link team using TypeScript and C# to modernize our web app's outdated Visual Basic shell. I graduated with Distinction from the College of LSA at the University of Michigan, where I majored in Computer Science and minored in Music. Previously, I interned at Qualtrics as a Software Development Engineering Intern, where I built a web portal using React which automated the submission of regulatory files. Other previous experience includes working as a Research Assistant with a professor from UM's School of Information, where I helped author and revise a computer science e-book which serves as a companion to the Python for Everybody series of Coursera courses taken by millions of beginner programmers.

The best way to contact me is via email at robminer@gmail.com. Please don't hesitate to reach out with any opportunities!
